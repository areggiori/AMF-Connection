AMF-Connection
==============

A simple module to write AMF [1] clients to invoke remote services as used by Flex/AIR RIAs.

The module includes basic support for synchronous HTTP/S based RPC request-response access, where 
the client sends a request to the server to be processed and the server returns a response to the client
containing the processing outcome. Data is sent back and forth in AMF binary format (AMFChannel). Other access patterns
such as pub/sub and channels transport are out of scope of this inital release.
